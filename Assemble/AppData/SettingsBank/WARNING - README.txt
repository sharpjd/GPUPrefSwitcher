YOU SHOULD NOT:
1. Manually store anything in this folder:
	- This app may delete unrelated/external files in this folder (e.g. the cleanup function).
2. Edit stored file contents manually: 
	- Changing or gaining access to the saved files may change their permissions and cause the file swapper to fail
	- Leaving files open in editors may lock files and prevent the file swapper from accessing them
	- You should instead use the "Spoof Power State" option to put the target file back in its place and then edit it
3. Move this folder around (even after the app is uninstalled):
	- Due to certain protection mechanisms, if you move the folder, its permissions may change, propagate,
	and make the FileSwapper fail. For now, this is a consequence of how the app was designed, and may be fixed in
	the future.
