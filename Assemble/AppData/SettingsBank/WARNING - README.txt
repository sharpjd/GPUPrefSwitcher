YOU SHOULD NOT:
1. Manually store anything in this folder:
	- This app may delete unrelated/external files in this folder (e.g. the cleanup function).
2. Edit stored file contents manually: 
	- Changing or gaining access to the saved files may change their permissions and cause the file swapper to fail
	- Leaving files open in editors may lock files and prevent the file swapper from accessing them
	- You should instead use the "Spoof Power State" option to put the target file back in its place and then edit it
